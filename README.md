# CRYPTO-CURR-PRICE-PRED_-MINI-PROJ

Crypto-currency such as Bitcoin is more popular these days among investors. In the proposed work, it is studied to forecast the Bitcoin price precisely considering different parameters that influence the Bitcoin price. This study first handles, it is identified the price trend on day by day changes in the Bitcoin price while it gives knowledge about Bitcoin price trends. The dataset till current date is taken with open, high, low and close price details of Bitcoin value. Exploiting the dataset machine learning module is introduced for prediction of price values. The aim of this work is to derive the accuracy of Bitcoin prediction using different machine learning algorithm and compare their accuracy. Experiment results are compared for decision tree and regression model.

# Proposed System 
Bitcoin dataset is considered from 2011 to till 2017 price and applied machine learning models such Linear regression and Time series network. The proposed learning method suggest the best algorithm to choose and adopt for crypto currency prediction problem.
